# TrainingCapacityManagement

With COVID19 training in Gyms isn't as easy as before. Ever before it was just a litte annoying if to many people turned up for a training, but now hygiene concepts have to be followed to be able to train.


This is a little tool I wrote for my Archery-Club which provides an easy way of online signups.

## Features
* Create trainings,
* Register for trainings,
* Have a list for trainers to cross check names.

## Currently missing
* Design is horrible.
* SendGrid implementation for automatic EMails.
