# TrainingCapacityManagement

With COVID19 training in Gyms isn't as easy as before. Ever before it was just a litte annoying if to many people turned up for a training, but now hygiene concepts have to be followed to be able to train.


This is a little tool I wrote for my Archery-Club which provides an easy way of online signups.

## Features
* Create trainings,
* Register for trainings,
* Have an attendee list for trainers to cross check names.
* Supports having different sports departments using the same side. Users can choose what trainings they see.


## Currently missing
* Design is horrible.
* Notify all attendees if a training is cancelled (SendGrid already included, but not implemented for this case)
* Code Cleanup
* Automatically recurring trainings
